1. Create your user account 
sudo su // this let you login as root user
adduser "yourUserName"
type in the password you want
2. Enable public key login
if don't have a public key, run ssh-keygen first. 
run ssh-copy-id "yourUserName"@IPAddress  on your local machine's terminal
this will install your machine's public key to the VM
if this is setup correctly, you won't need to type in password the next time you login
3. After you created your own user account, 
please run ssh "yourUserName"@IPaddress instead of ssh group-6612@IPAddress to login
